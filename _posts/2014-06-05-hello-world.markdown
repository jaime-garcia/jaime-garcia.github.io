I am Jaime Garcia. I live in Virginia with my wife and two cats. I started my development career with a TI-83 calculator in the eight grade, in order to  make Algebra a little easier. After that I moved on to Turbo Pascal and C++ in High School. It was then that I knew that a career in software development was right for me. Currently, I'm mostly a Java developer working on web applications for the US Federal Government. During my free time, I try to keep up with our ever changing world of languages, frameworks, and tools. 

I believe in developing clean software, and that's one of my motivations in starting this blog. I believe software maintainability is one of the most important aspects of software development. I advocate Test Driven Development and favor Agile processes. I believe our industry is still young, and there's room for improvement in the quality of software that we create. I find this especially in the US Federal sector.
